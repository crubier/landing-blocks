## project generation
a wizard takes the values to continue, every step is made by a single sorm element
the form shows the next button only after the user has made the form dirty and validation passes
at the end the form stores the values in memory and redirects to a page that takes these values, calls the function generatePage that creates the jsx tree for the page and then converts it to code adding the imports and exports.

the function creates the tree adding elements gradually, with components and styling based on user choices

finally you can download the file

## how to manage multiple styles for the same component

for every component type make a folder, the index will be the component types and structure
other files will have other variations of the same component with changes in layout, icons used, font sizes, background styling, ...
each variation will still be customizable with theme colors, fonts and you can replace certain illustration and icons (the decorations and animations will be built in)

## switch between dark and light backgrounds

all the texts will have a color that changes based on the background brightness to maintain always the max contrast, the same with icons fill and stroke

## customize content

to change content you can use object props and not compound components because object props are more easily discoverable and typed

## themeable

colors - primary (primary color for cta buttons, certain decoration elements, illustrations, icons ) - black, used for text, - primary background, the page background - secondary background, break certain sections with darker look
font

## What

The assets are only svg and fonts, schema are unlined in code, fonts are taken with google fonts
